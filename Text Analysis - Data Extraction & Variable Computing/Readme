The objective is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below. 
For each of the articles, given in the input.xlsx file, extract the article text and save the extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name.
My program extracts only the article title and the article text. It does not extract the website header, footer, or anything other than the article text. 
For each of the extracted texts from the article, I have to perform textual analysis and compute variables, given in the output structure excel file.
Definition of each of the variables are given in the “Text Analysis.docx” file
Look for these variables in the analysis document (Text Analysis.docx):
1.	POSITIVE SCORE
2.	NEGATIVE SCORE
3.	POLARITY SCORE
4.	SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
5.	AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
6.	PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
7.	FOG INDEX
8.	AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
9.	COMPLEX WORD COUNT
10.	WORD COUNT
11.	SYLLABLE PER WORD
12.	PERSONAL PRONOUNS
13.	AVG WORD LENGTH
I have attached all the files required. After reading this, Please open the “Text Analysis.docx” file to have a better understanding of the variables.
I have uploaded both .py file and .ipynb files.
To run the .py file please check the instruction file. It expains how I have did the analysis.
